The goal of this project is to use a servo and ultrasonic sensor to scan for objects like a sonar. An arduino will take data from the sensor and 
create a sonar visual of the objects


### Functionality to Add
- Basic sonar functionality
    - Need to find degree conversion of OCR1B
- Display of what sonar sees
- Start menu to set range of sonar
- On/off "switch"

#### Display Notes:
Need to decided on a physical display to use and a library to create graphics. Possible options are below.
